## Running the experiments
To reproduce the experiments please refer to:

- [D-TDG/README.md](https://github.com/gravins/dynamic_graph_benchmark/tree/main/D-TDG) to reproduce the experiments on the *Discrete-Time Dynamic Graph* domain. 
- [C-TDG/README.md](https://github.com/gravins/dynamic_graph_benchmark/tree/main/C-TDG) to reproduce the experiments on the *Continuous-Time Dynamic Graph* domain.
